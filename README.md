Weather Monitor and Web
=======================

weatherd is a hackish weather data logger for my homemade Raspberry Pi
based weather station.  The project is under heavy development and all
code, as well as scope, is still in the early prototyping stages.


Idea
----

The idea is to place a few sensors in one of the vents of my garage to
monitor temperaure, pressure and light.  Temperature and pressure to
figure out if I should go out or stay indoors and order pizza, light to
control indoor lightning via 433 MHz outlets.


Install
-------

    sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev
